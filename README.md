# clj-native-cmd

A simple template for making cli apps with clojure and compiling with graalvm.

## Usage

A leiningen template is generated from this project with `lein-create-template`:

    lein new clj-native-cmd my-cli

You should be able to build a native-image using:

    lein native-image

You will need `native-image` available on your path.

Tested with:

    Clojure 1.9.0
    GraalVM Version 19.2.1 CE
    Darwin Kernel Version 18.0.0
    MacOS 10.14 Mojave

N.B. Do not upgrade to clojure 1.10 with this template until [this bug is fixed](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-1472) you will not be able to create a native binary with graalvm.
